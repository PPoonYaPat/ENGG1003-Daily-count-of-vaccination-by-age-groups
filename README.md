# ENGG1003-Daily-count-of-vaccination-by-age-groups
This data analysis project focuses on analyzing the dataset titled "Daily count of vaccination by age groups" obtained from data.gov.hk. The project aims to provide insights and statistics regarding the vaccination of the different age groups and also the trust of people on each type of vaccine, namely Sinovac and BioNTech. Furthermore, the number of doses and type of vaccine will also be clearly shown, together with the description to show the connection between each year, sex and the age groups. All of these data will be adjusted, grouped, calculated and plotted as a different type of graph for the ease of reading in this project.
